All members of the group will see the same random die roll and must remember that roll.<br>
The group will then have to input the value of those die rolls on two subsequent pages. <br>
    You will be able to discuss with your teammates what the roll is. <br>
    There are no checks completed during the game, you will be paid based on what you report <br>
The first page will represent the groups income with the following payouts:<br>
