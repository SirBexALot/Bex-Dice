<p>In this experiment, you will see one dice roll which you must report on 2 subsequent pages. <br>
    The first page will represent you company's income <br>
    The payouts are as follows: </p>
    <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Dice Roll 1</th> <td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>6</td> </tr>
    <tr><th>Payout</th><td>1</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>4</td><td>5</td><td>0</td>
  </tr>
    </table>

<p>The second page will represent an additional amount split between you and a charity<br>
The payouts for the second roll are as follows:</p>
<html> <head> <style>
table {
  table-layout:fixed;
  width: 560px }
th, td {

  width: 80 px }
</style> </head>  <body>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Dice Roll 2</th>
      <td>1</td> <td>2</td> <td>3</td> <td>4</td> <td>5</td> <td>6</td>
      </tr>
    <tr>
    <th>Your payout</th>
      <td>2</td> <td>4</td> <td>6</td> <td>8</td> <td>10</td> <td>0</td>
        </tr>
    <th>Charity</th>
      <td>8</td> <td>6</td> <td>4</td> <td>2</td> <td>0</td> <td>10</td>
    </table>
<p>You may enter any number between 1 and 6 on the pages. <br>
    No audits will be run during the experiment to check the accuracy of your selection, <br>
    your payment will be based on the numbers you enter.
    You will only have a maximum of 1 minute to make your selection. <br>
    To maintain the flow of the experiment, everyone will move forward together <br>
    <!--The experiment is set up having wait pages for the in lab experiment.
     You would have to do some more coding to get rid of them,
     but if the pages are only up for 1 minute max (how I have it now)
     it won't take super long even with waiting and is probably better to leave it -->
Your real life payout will be in a ratio of ??? points = $1 CAD</p>
<button class="otree-btn-next5 btn btn-primary" id="Next" style="visibility: hidden;">Next</button>
<!-- and this. put this part where you want your next button-->
