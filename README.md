# Bex-Dice
My dice
In this set of experiments people either roll one or two dice alone or in groups either in a fixed order or with random draws.
The naming convention goes #participants, type of roll (fixed or random), how many rolls are seen
For the number of participants groups are set to 3. This can be changed in the constants. single is for an individual
For the type of roll random will be any number from 1 to 6. If you want to change it, you can choose the numbers in the constants variable "options" and swtich the function to the random.choice function. For fixed rolls, those are changed in the HTML file. Groups are set up with 4 treatments so that you can have different numbers seen by different groups, single is set with the same number for each person. If you want the singles to have treatments you can copy the whole creating session portion from a group experiment. If you want all groups to see the same thing, you can erase (or comment it out) 
For how many rolls are seen, with 1 roll it is seen before the two pages that the participants enter their roll number, for 2 rolls its seen on the same page. If you want, I can change it so that people see the rolls on one page and then enter them on another (to give them more plausible deniability about the number not being what they see). 
Currently they are all set up for revenue page first, to change that to charity page first, you need to switch the page sequence and add the payoff portion to the revenue wait page.
